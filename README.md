# LibVoice

> A PHP library for developing custom voice assistant interactions. 

## Introduction
This is a major rewrite of the amazon-alexa-php library by [minicodemonkey](https://github.com/MiniCodeMonkey),
[jakubsuchy](https://github.com/jakubsuchy) and [danstreeter](https://github.com/danstreeter). It sticks closer
to [Amazon's Reference for Custom Skills](https://developer.amazon.com/de/docs/custom-skills/request-and-response-json-reference.html)
while keeping preparation for future updates. 

## Requirements
* PHP (at least 5.6.0)
* [composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

## Usage
Require the library in your composer.json: 
```php
{
    "require": {
        "internetofvoice/libvoice": "~1.0"
    }
}
```
